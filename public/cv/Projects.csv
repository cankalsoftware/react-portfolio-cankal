Fire and Smoke detection with DCNN and computer vision,"This project proposes the development of a real-time smoke and fire detection system using computer vision and Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs). The goal is to address the growing problem of wildfires and urban fire hazards by climate change. With the aid of existing security camera infrastructure, the system will serve as an early warning mechanism capable of identifying fire signs, such as smoke and flame. The project is designed to demonstrate not only technical innovation but also real-world utility, laying the foundation for a future commercial product. Key outcomes include: A prototype application capable of detecting smoke and fire in real-time Evaluation of existing literature to identify state-of-the-art models and gaps Performance testing and validation with both open and custom datasets",,Jun 2025,
